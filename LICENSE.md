Independent Software Vendors that want the benefits of embedding Surefire software in their commercial applications but do not want to be subject to the Surefire Public License ("SPL") and do not want to release the source code for their proprietary applications must purchase a commercial license from the Surefire team. Purchasing a commercial license means that the Surefire Public License ("SPL") does not apply, and a commercial license includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements. If use of Surefire under the SPL does not satisfy your organization's legal department you should also enter into a commercial license agreement with the Surefire team.
